- Setup

As this is a sandbox, ideally we want to keep at its current base state.
To do this, you need to create your own git repository and copy this
code into it.


Step 1: Clone this repo (Setup your ssh for git if you've not already)

git clone git@github.com:gbutch/qa-node-blog.git

Step 2: Rename the folder to whatever you want

Step 3: delete the .git file

Step 4: Initialize a new git repository

git init

Step 5: Make an initial commit

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin master
